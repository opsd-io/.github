# What is OPSd?

OPSdiy project aims to equip developers, startups, and software houses with tools to manage cloud infrastructure efficiently. Our registry comprises Terraform tailor-made modules designed to manage multiple providers in a unified way. The project is run in the open-source convention as a form of thanks to the community whose resources we have used so often in recent years.

# Wide range of supported vendors

We are focused on delivering infrastructure-as-code (IaC) modules to support the leading vendors on the market, like Amazon Web Services (AWS), DigitalOcean, and Azure (soon). We do not focus on supporting every single service of a given provider but rather on obtaining a given functionality that will enable us to change the service provider smoothly, if necessary.

# We are open for the PR's
We thrive on collaboration and contributions from the community. Whether you're a seasoned developer, a DevOps enthusiast, or someone passionate about cloud technology. There are numerous ways to get involved and make a difference:
* Code Contributions,
* Documentation,
* Testing and Feedback.

No contribution is too small, and every contribution helps propel OPSd forward.
