# What is OPSd?
OPSd is a project where we want to share our knowledge and experience in creating and managing cloud infrastructure. This knowledge is stored in the form of Terraform, Ansible and Helm modules that we use daily to provide reliable services to our customers worldwide.

# Why are we doing this? 
We have been using Open Source solutions for years. It's time we gave something back to this community.
